Note that it is not always necessary to skip certain information exchanges, but that it is possible to combine them with limited extra cost. A disadvantage of a smaller number of contacts might be the loss of essential information, which is a quality issue.

Companies must also consider that not all tasks included in business processes can be performed by customers.\n\nPerformance considerations: Empowered interaction capability, concerted interaction capability.\n\nBy applying this redesign pattern, the employees' workload could be reduced and employees could focus on the narrower and more specialized scope of tasks. Additionally, when a substantial part of the process can be delegated to customers themselves, it has the potential to free up resource capacity, thereby reducing the need for additional resources, e.g., self-service options in grocery stores. Furthermore, customers can experience reduced waiting times as they no longer have to queue for employee assistance. However, it's crucial to underline that customers should reap tangible benefits from this integration, such as shorter waiting times. If customers do not perceive significant advantages (e.g., customers perform part of the process but waiting times remain high), customer satisfaction may decrease.\n",
        "examples": "Example 1\nIn an outpatient process at a hospital, long waiting times and patient queues occurred due to a lack of personnel to serve all the patients in time. The most extended delay occurred in the payment procedure where the patients needed to wait in a queue for a long time to be served by the cashiers. To overcome delays in the payment procedure, self-payment devices were introduced. Thus, part of the patients are served by the cashiers, and the other part uses self-service devices to make payments. [107]\n\nExample 2 \nIn an incident reporting process at an IT Help Desk, only 30% of the total number of incidents are recorded. Minor issues are not recorded at all. Hence, the same or similar issues are repeatedly solved from scratch which increases the cycle time of the process. A client self-service can be used for resolving minor issues by clients themselves. With access to the Knowledge Base System, clients can review the recorded minor incidents and fix them without contacting customer service. [73]\n\nExample 3 \nA registrar's office at a university deals with several processes, one of which is the matriculation renewal process, which takes place twice a year. During the weeks when the renewal of matriculation occurs, the personnel resources are overloaded, causing the personnel resources to work at high capacity (high resource utilization). Some activities can be assigned to external parties, for instance, a customer: in the matriculation renewal process, students enter their personal data into the system themselves instead of the office workers. [133]\n\nExample 4 \nIn the Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection request handling process, the cost analysis of the process was conducted.

Commonly, a bottleneck occurs when the patients arrive to get a tomography scan as they have to wait to be served. Taking into account the demand rate, the throughput of the process is low, i.e., meaning that fewer customers get the service in relation to those waiting. Redesign: Better customer scheduling techniques can eliminate/reduce bottlenecks in the process. In the CT scan process, for instance, the following methods were proposed:\n(1) Schedule patients to build up a buffer of work on standby.\n(2) Schedule patients to minimize variation in cycle times (for example, time slots with homogeneous patient groups).\n(3) Reduce tardiness, no-shows, cancellations, and other disruptions of schedules. [84]\n\nExample 2 \nIn a healthcare recovery ward process, the end of a workday shift (3:45 p.m.) and the end of surgery are the busiest periods during the day. That puts pressure on nurses, making them postpone admissions to the care unit. To address these issues, customer scheduling is introduced. It helps to distribute the workload evenly throughout the day. Thus, all appointments are scheduled according to the employees' pre-defined availability, heavy hours do not intersect, and overloads are avoided. [147]",

The average number of mistakes found by this review is low: only in 1% of cases mistakes are detected. While there is value in finding mistakes, the effort required outweighs the benefit therefrom.

Then shift supervisor goes to the production line to assign the orders to the operator. Going from the meeting to the office and then to the production line are the shift supervisor's unnecessary motions. Redesign: Motion activities should be eliminated whenever possible.

    "Case-based work": {

        "explanations": "This pattern recognizes that practical business processes often deviate from the ideal case-based and make-to-order concepts. It acknowledges the presence of constraints like work item batching and periodic activities that rely on specific computer system availability. These constraints can hinder the efficient handling of cases and impede process performance.\n\nBy applying this pattern, organizations can strive to remove these constraints and align their business processes more closely with the case-based approach. This entails eliminating the piling up of work items in batches and finding alternatives to periodic activities that rely on specific system availability. The ultimate goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient process where cases can be handled promptly and without unnecessary delays.\n\nTo understand how this pattern can be enacted in an example process, let's consider a customer support system in an e-commerce company. Currently, the support team receives customer queries in batches and processes them in bulk, leading to delays in response times and potential customer dissatisfaction. The periodic activities, such as generating automated reports or system updates, are performed at fixed times, causing further delays in case resolution.\n\nBy introducing the case-based work pattern, the company can transition to a more efficient and responsive process. They can implement an automated ticketing system that assigns individual cases to support agents as soon as they arrive. This eliminates the need for batch processing and ensures timely attention to each customer inquiry.\n\nAdditionally, the company can leverage technology to remove constraints related to periodic activities. For example, instead of relying on specific system availability for generating reports, they can implement real-time reporting dashboards that are accessible to agents at any time. This enables them to access up-to-date information and resolve cases promptly, without being dependent on specific processing windows.\n\nThrough the adoption of the pattern, the customer support process becomes more streamlined, cases are handled promptly, and customer satisfaction improves. The removal of constraints allows for more agility and responsiveness, resulting in a more efficient and effective support system.\n\n1 Address Constraints: The pattern aims to eliminate constraints such as work item batching and reliance on periodic activities tied to specific computer system availability.\n2 Speed up Case Handling: By removing these constraints, the pattern can significantly improve the efficiency and speed of case handling.\n3 Consider Efficiency vs. Cost: While eliminating constraints may enhance case handling, it is crucial to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of streamlined processes and the potential costs involved.\n\nSwitching to case-based work can have significant performance implications on the overall process. By eliminating work item batching, cases can be handled more swiftly, reducing delays and improving customer satisfaction. Removing reliance on specific system availability for periodic activities ensures that tasks can be performed consistently, avoiding bottlenecks caused by limited processing windows.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider the trade-off between efficiency and cost. While streamlining the process and removing constraints can enhance case handling, it may require investments in infrastructure, technology, and system availability. Organizations need to assess the potential financial implications and weigh them against the benefits gained in terms of improved efficiency, customer experience, and overall process performance",

        "explanations": "The pattern focuses on the recognition that exceptions in a workflow can disrupt normal operations and cause inefficiencies. To address this, the pattern suggests separating exceptions from the regular flow of work to improve overall process performance.\n\nBy isolating exceptions, organizations can assign dedicated workers or teams who specialize in handling these unique cases. This enables the development of specialized expertise and knowledge, leading to more effective and efficient resolution of exceptions. Additionally, by filtering out exceptions, organizations can streamline their processes, potentially implementing Straight-Through-Processing where applicable, reducing manual intervention, and increasing operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider the trade-off between the benefits and the associated costs and complexities. Isolating exceptions can add complexity to the workflow, potentially decreasing its flexibility. It may require additional resources to train and develop specialized knowledge among workers. Without investing in specialized expertise, the desired improvements in handling exceptions may not be realized.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1 Specialized Exception Handling: By assigning specific workers or teams to handle exceptions, expertise can be developed, leading to more effective resolution.\n2 Straight-Through-Processing: Filtering out exceptions may enable the implementation of streamlined, automated processes, reducing manual intervention.\n3 Consider Complexity and Cost: Isolating exceptions adds complexity to the workflow and requires investment in developing specialized knowledge.\nPerformance considerations\nBy separating exceptions, normal case handling becomes more efficient as workers can focus on regular cases without being disrupted by unfamiliar or complex situations. This reduces setup times wasted on dealing with exceptions that workers may not be adequately equipped to handle.\n\nThe specialization of workers or teams in handling exceptions leads to the development of expertise, resulting in more effective and timely resolution of these unique cases. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction, streamlined processes, and reduced operational costs. Additionally, by filtering out exceptions and implementing Straight-Through-Processing, organizations can automate routine tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing process efficiency.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to carefully manage the added complexity that comes with isolating exceptions. The workflow may become more intricate, requiring proper coordination and communication between teams. Furthermore, organizations need to consider the investment required in developing specialized knowledge among workers handling exceptions, as it may involve training, resources, and ongoing support.",
        "examples": "An illustrative example of this pattern can be found in a healthcare setting. In a hospital, the triage process serves as a practical application of isolating exceptions. Patients arriving at the emergency department are initially assessed by triage nurses who quickly identify urgent cases that require immediate attention, such as critical injuries or life-threatening conditions. These cases are isolated and given priority, ensuring they receive specialized care promptly. Meanwhile, the regular flow of patients is handled separately, improving the overall efficiency of patient care delivery in the hospital.",

Additional capacities, for instance, another scan room in the example of the computed tomography scan process, can be introduced leading to adding human resources as well. The introduction of longer working hours can also increase the number of patients served per day with the increase in the involved resources. [84]\n\nExample 4 \nIn an outpatient process at a hospital, long waiting times and patient queues exist due to a lack of personnel to serve all the patients in time. The most extended delay occurred in the payment procedure where the patients needed to wait in a queue for a long time to be served by the cashiers.

    "Task automation": {

        "explanations": "A technique for automating routine and repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe \"Activity Automation\" pattern centers around using technology to automate repetitive and routine tasks within a process. By automating these activities, organizations can reduce errors, save time, and allocate resources more effectively. Activity Automation can be accomplished through various tools such as robotic process automation (RPA) or workflow management systems.\n\nThe primary objective of Activity Automation is to eliminate manual effort and reduce the reliance on human intervention for tasks that are repetitive and rule-based. By leveraging automation technology, organizations can improve accuracy, enhance efficiency, and streamline their processes. Employees are freed from mundane and routine activities, allowing them to focus on more strategic and value-added tasks that require human expertise.\n\nImplementing Activity Automation brings significant performance implications to a process. By automating routine tasks, organizations can reduce the risk of human errors, enhancing data accuracy and quality. Time and resource savings are achieved as tasks that were previously manually performed can now be executed efficiently and effectively through automation. This leads to improved overall process efficiency, allowing for faster completion of tasks and reduced cycle times.\n\nFurthermore, Activity Automation enables employees to shift their focus from repetitive tasks to more strategic activities. This not only improves job satisfaction but also enhances the organization's ability to innovate and deliver higher-value outcomes. By leveraging automation technology, organizations can optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and achieve operational excellence.\n\n1 Automate Routine Tasks: Activity Automation involves using technology to automate repetitive and routine tasks, such as data entry or report generation.\n2 Semi-Automate: Instead of fully automating a task, automatic support also be considered.\n3 Tools for Automation: Activity Automation can be achieved through robotic process automation (RPA) or workflow management systems.\n\nThe positive result of automating tasks can be, in particular, that the tasks can be carried out faster, at a lower cost, and with a better result. An obvious disadvantage is that developing a system to perform a task can be costly. In general, a system that performs a task is also less flexible in dealing with fluctuations than a human resource.",
        "examples": "Example 1 \nManual calculations refer to those activities where calculations are performed by hand or using self-made spreadsheets, possibly causing quality problems and additional effort. Manual calculations can be automated, for instance, with specialized information systems. [30]\n\nExample 2 \nIn a surgical process, hospital personnel had to count each item and surgical tool manually. Before the operation starts, the surgical items are manually counted and verified by two people. This count is then tallied after the surgery is performed. This process is cumbersome, considering that some surgical procedures require between 170 to 300 tools to be counted and verified. Manual counting of the surgical instruments is automated with the tracking IT system based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. [50, 54]\n\nExample 3 \nIn a hospital, the process of linen inventory, including distribution, laundry, packing, storing, and collection of linens from different wards requires the staff to manually count linens by estimating the number of linens in the bundles. The estimate does not often reflect the true quantity of linens sent out to the sub-contractor. This process is time-consuming and often results in data errors. Radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology is applied to automate manual tasks of linen counting using RFID stations in the linen department and the wards. Thus, the number of data errors in the process decreases. [54]\n\nExample 4\nRegistrar's office at a university runs the process of matriculation renewal. When matriculation renewal is requested, an employee checks if the payment is received and correct. If so, the matriculation renewal is performed. If not, matriculation renewal is rejected. The decision taken as a result of the payment check is based on predefined rules. Thus, manual routine decisions can be automated based on predefined rules according to which they are made. In a matriculation renewal process, the payment check and decision-making can be automated. [133]\n\nExample 5\nIn a process, the incoming payments listed on bank statements are manually matched against invoices issued to customers. Manual checks are automated. [72]\n\nExample 6\nIn a review process at a university, the study coordinator has to inform the professor in charge that s/he must review the available documents again. For that, the study coordinator needs to find the professor in charge or send an email. Manual notifications can be automated. Thus. in the objection review process in a university, the responsible professor is informed automatically right after the objection document is uploaded into the system. Thus, a reduced cycle time of about 2 minutes is expected. [63]\n\nExample 7 \nIn a patient discharge process, the ward clerk accesses and updates the hospital\u2019s database to actualize a patient\u2019s discharge. Furthermore, the clerk logs into the central database to arrange a follow-up appointment for the patient. Manual data entry activities can be automated. For instance, instead of manual data updates in the hospital database, the updates are performed automatically by the system itself. In a patient discharge process, a patient tracking system based on Radio frequency identification (RFID) automatically updates the patients' status. [139]",

These activities need to be organized in such a way that organizations are most profitable and ecological goals within a given environment can be met. Rationalizing some activities is one possibility to reach this objective.\n\nChallenges\nThe identification of activities that can be automated can be a challenging task. The automated activity needs to perform the task in such a way that either the result remains the same or is even improved or the costs are getting much lower. In the latter case the trade-off between the environmental impact, the costs, and the expected quality needs to be addressed in detail. It must further ensure the global integration with other activities that are dependent on that activity.\n\nSolution\nOrganizations (partially) streamline specific activities within a business process by automating them.\n\nVariations\nSingle activities must not be totally automated. They can also be semi-automated or split into an automated and a manual part to better (i.e. more efficiently) support human process performance.\n\nRelations to other Patterns\nThis pattern is strongly related to Human Process Performance as it covers the contrary situation. Depending on the structure of the business process, both patterns can be used to ecologically optimize processes on an activity changing basis.\n\nThe automatization of specific process activities provides the means for optimizations from both, a regular and an ecological perspective.

To reduce waiting times in the healthcare processes, scheduling and technological solutions (workflow management programs) are used to synchronize the customer arrival rate and reduce waiting times.
